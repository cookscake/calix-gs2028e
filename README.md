# CALIX-GS2028E
This is just a personal hardware hacking project to learn more about routers, firmware, and the potential for running OpenWRT on unsupported devices.

# TODO: UART
There are a few places on the pcb that need soldered jumpers in order to gain UART access.

# TODO: JTAG
It looks like there is an unpopulated jtag header on the board that requires no soldering.

# Support Login
You can gain access to more settings in the admin UI by logging in as the `support` user. You must enter the default router password followed by `!5upporT`. For example, if the password found on the sticker underneath the router is `abcd123`, you would enter the password `abcd123!5upporT` to login.

# Updates
I will be updating this repository as I make progress in my free time.
